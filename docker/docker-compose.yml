# OpenClaw Docker Compose Configuration

# This file is a REFERENCE - the actual compose file is generated
# by cloud-init on the server. Use this for local testing only.

# Security notes:
# - Binds to localhost ONLY (Tailscale Serve handles external access)
# - no-new-privileges prevents privilege escalation
# - All capabilities dropped except those needed
