# Run Summary: US-016 — Investigate data-driven agent variables

## Result: COMPLETE

## What was done
- Audited `pulumi/index.ts` and `scripts/provision.sh` for per-agent variable duplication
- Counted 54 per-agent lines in index.ts across 6 categories
- Counted 91 per-agent lines in provision.sh across 6 categories
- Total: 145 lines across 12 locations must be edited to add one new agent
- Assessed Pulumi resource URN risk: safe if logical names are preserved
- Identified Telegram and Obsidian config as non-loopable (irregular structure)
- Proposed data structures for both TypeScript (agent registry array) and Bash (associative arrays)
- Recommendation: Conditional Go with medium effort (3-5h)

## Files changed
- `docs/INVESTIGATION-data-driven-agent-variables.md` (new — investigation document)

## Verification
- Investigation-only story — no infrastructure or code changes
- Quality gates (provision.sh --check --diff, verify.sh) not applicable for docs-only changes
