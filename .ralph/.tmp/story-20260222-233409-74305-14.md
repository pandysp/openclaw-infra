### US-015: Investigate reusable Docker image build task
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-014

Description:
As a maintainer, I want to understand the feasibility and effort of extracting the 3 near-identical Docker image build blocks in plugins/tasks/main.yml into a single parameterized include so that future MCP server additions don't require copying 150 lines.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document the current duplication: list the 3 blocks (Codex, Claude Code, Pi) with their line ranges and identify which parts are identical vs. which differ
- [ ] Identify the parameters needed for a reusable build-mcp-image.yml: image name, build dir, Dockerfile template, container label, force rebuild var, smoke test commands
- [ ] Identify risks: are there any subtle differences between the 3 blocks that would make parameterization unsafe?
- [ ] Provide an effort estimate (small/medium/large) and a go/no-go recommendation
- [ ] Output is a brief document (can be inline in the story completion notes or a file in docs/)
- [ ] Negative case: if parameterization is not feasible (e.g., too many differences), explain why and close the story
