### US-006: Move sandbox containers to separate Docker network
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-005

Description:
As a security-conscious deployer, I want sandbox containers to run on a separate Docker network from the MCP auth proxy so that prompt-injected sandbox sessions cannot directly access credentials.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In ansible/group_vars/all.yml: change openclaw_sandbox_docker_network from 'codex-proxy-net' to 'bridge' (the default Docker bridge network)
- [ ] MCP containers (Codex, Claude Code, Pi) remain on codex-proxy-net and retain proxy access
- [ ] The docker role in ansible/roles/docker/tasks/main.yml still creates codex-proxy-net unconditionally (for MCP containers)
- [ ] Sandbox containers can still reach the internet for web research and git operations (bridge provides outbound NAT)
- [ ] Sandbox containers CANNOT reach the MCP auth proxy IP/port
- [ ] Example: a sandbox session running curl http://<proxy-gateway-ip>:8787/ gets connection refused or timeout
- [ ] Negative case: a Codex MCP container running on codex-proxy-net can still reach the proxy successfully
- [ ] Gateway health check passes after the change
- [ ] Update docs/SECURITY.md if it references the sandbox network configuration
