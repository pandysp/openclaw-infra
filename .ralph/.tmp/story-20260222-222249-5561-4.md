### US-003: Fix stale token return in MCP auth proxy getAccessToken()
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a system administrator, I want the MCP auth proxy to fail visibly when it cannot read credentials so that permanently unreadable auth files cause clear errors rather than silently using expired tokens.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In mcp-auth-proxy.js.j2 getAccessToken() (line ~79): if the file read fails AND cachedToken is null/undefined, throw an error instead of returning null
- [ ] If the file read fails AND cachedToken exists, log a warning with the error details and return cachedToken (grace period for transient errors)
- [ ] Add a staleness check: if cachedToken was last successfully refreshed more than 1 hour ago and file reads keep failing, log an error-level message on each failed attempt
- [ ] Example: auth.json is deleted -> first call returns cached token with warning, subsequent calls log errors, proxy does not silently use a days-old token without any indication
- [ ] Negative case: transient file read failure (e.g., brief disk IO) does not crash the proxy — cached token is used with a warning
- [ ] The proxy continues to function during normal operation (auth.json readable) with no behavioral change
