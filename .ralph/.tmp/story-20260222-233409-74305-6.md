### US-008: Add gateway restart trap to backup.sh
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-007

Description:
As an operator, I want the backup script to always restart the gateway even if the script fails so that a backup failure does not leave the gateway stopped indefinitely.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In scripts/backup.sh: add a trap that restarts the openclaw-gateway service on EXIT (similar to the cleanup trap in get-telegram-id.sh)
- [ ] The trap runs the gateway restart via SSH on the remote host (since backup.sh runs locally and stops the gateway remotely)
- [ ] Example: backup.sh fails mid-backup due to disk space -> gateway is restarted automatically before the script exits
- [ ] Negative case: backup.sh completes successfully -> gateway is restarted as part of normal flow (trap is harmless if gateway is already running)
- [ ] The trap handles the case where SSH itself is broken (trap should not fail hard if the restart SSH command fails)
