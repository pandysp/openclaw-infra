### US-005: Fix Pi MCP auth smoke test swallowing failures
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-004

Description:
As an operator, I want the Pi MCP Docker image smoke test to fail the provisioning run when authentication validation fails so that broken auth is not silently deployed.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In ansible/roles/plugins/tasks/main.yml line ~1072: remove or replace the unconditional failed_when: false on the Pi auth smoke test task
- [ ] The task should fail when the shell script exits non-zero (auth validation failure), causing the Ansible play to fail
- [ ] Add a rescue block (consistent with Codex and Claude Code smoke test patterns) that captures diagnostic info before failing
- [ ] Example: Pi auth is misconfigured -> provisioning fails with a clear error message identifying the Pi auth smoke test as the failure point
- [ ] Negative case: Pi auth is correctly configured -> smoke test passes and provisioning continues
- [ ] Review other smoke test tasks in the same file for the same failed_when: false pattern and fix any found
