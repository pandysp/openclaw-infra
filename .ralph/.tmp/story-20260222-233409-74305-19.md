### US-017: Investigate handler consolidation
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-016

Description:
As a maintainer, I want to understand whether the 5 duplicate 'restart openclaw-gateway' handler definitions can be consolidated into a single play-level handler so that handler changes don't require editing 5 files.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document which roles define the restart handler and confirm they are all identical
- [ ] Test whether a play-level handler in playbook.yml is accessible from all roles (Ansible handler scoping rules)
- [ ] Identify risks: handler flushing order, interaction with role-specific handlers, any role that uses include_role (which changes handler scope)
- [ ] Provide an effort estimate and go/no-go recommendation
- [ ] Output is a brief investigation document
- [ ] Negative case: if Ansible handler scoping prevents play-level handlers from working with all roles, explain the limitation
