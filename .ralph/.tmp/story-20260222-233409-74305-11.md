### US-012: Fix CLAUDE.md server type default and tool counts
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-011

Description:
As a deployer using the public template, I want CLAUDE.md to accurately reflect the default server type and use formulas for tool counts so that I know what to expect on a fresh deployment.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Cost Breakdown: add a note that the default is CX33 (4 vCPU, 8GB, ~5.49/mo) and CX43 is recommended when qmd is enabled
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Semantic Search section: replace '18 total' with a formula like '6 x N_agents total' that doesn't go stale when agents are added
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Semantic Search tool count formula: replace hardcoded per-type counts with a note that exact counts depend on agent count and configured server types
- [ ] Example: a user deploying the public template with default settings sees accurate cost and resource expectations
- [ ] Negative case: the documentation does not claim CX43 is the default when the code defaults to CX33
