### US-002: Fix shell injection via unescaped JSON and jq in Ansible tasks
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-001

Description:
As an operator, I want Ansible shell tasks to safely handle JSON output and agent IDs so that unexpected characters in command output or config values cannot break shell scripts or jq filters.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In ansible/roles/agents/tasks/main.yml: existing_agents.stdout is written to a temp file instead of inline single-quoted shell string. The temp file is cleaned up in an always block
- [ ] In ansible/roles/agents/tasks/main.yml: item.id is passed to jq using --arg instead of inline Jinja2 interpolation in the jq filter string
- [ ] Same fixes applied to ansible/roles/telegram/tasks/bindings.yml line 22 where JSON is interpolated into shell
- [ ] Same fixes applied to ansible/roles/agents/tasks/main.yml line 43 where JSON comparison uses inline interpolation
- [ ] Example: an agent ID containing a double quote character does not break the jq expression
- [ ] Negative case: JSON output containing single quotes does not break the shell script
- [ ] ./scripts/provision.sh --check --diff runs without errors
