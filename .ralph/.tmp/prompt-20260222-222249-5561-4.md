## Selected Story (Do not change scope)
ID: US-003
Title: Fix stale token return in MCP auth proxy getAccessToken()

Story details:
### US-003: Fix stale token return in MCP auth proxy getAccessToken()
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-002

Description:
As a system administrator, I want the MCP auth proxy to fail visibly when it cannot read credentials so that permanently unreadable auth files cause clear errors rather than silently using expired tokens.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In mcp-auth-proxy.js.j2 getAccessToken() (line ~79): if the file read fails AND cachedToken is null/undefined, throw an error instead of returning null
- [ ] If the file read fails AND cachedToken exists, log a warning with the error details and return cachedToken (grace period for transient errors)
- [ ] Add a staleness check: if cachedToken was last successfully refreshed more than 1 hour ago and file reads keep failing, log an error-level message on each failed attempt
- [ ] Example: auth.json is deleted -> first call returns cached token with warning, subsequent calls log errors, proxy does not silently use a days-old token without any indication
- [ ] Negative case: transient file read failure (e.g., brief disk IO) does not crash the proxy — cached token is used with a warning
- [ ] The proxy continues to function during normal operation (auth.json readable) with no behavioral change


If the story details are empty or missing, STOP and report that the PRD story format could not be parsed.

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Implement **only** the work required to complete the selected story.
- Complete all tasks associated with this story (and only this story).
- Do NOT ask the user questions.
- Do NOT change unrelated code.
- Do NOT assume something is unimplemented — confirm by reading code.
- Implement completely; no placeholders or stubs.
- If No-commit is true, do NOT commit or push changes.
- Do NOT edit the PRD JSON (status is handled by the loop).
- All changes made during the run must be committed (including updates to progress/logs).
 - Before committing, perform a final **security**, **performance**, and **regression** review of your changes.

## Your Task (Do this in order)
1. Read /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/guardrails.md before any code changes.
2. Read /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/errors.log for repeated failures to avoid.
3. Read /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.agents/tasks/prd-review-action-plan.json for global context (do not edit).
4. Fully audit and read all necessary files to understand the task end-to-end before implementing. Do not assume missing functionality.
5. If /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/AGENTS.md exists, follow its build/test instructions.
6. Implement only the tasks that belong to US-003.
7. Run verification commands listed in the story, the global quality gates, and in /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/AGENTS.md (if required).
8. If the project has a build or dev workflow, run what applies:
   - Build step (e.g., `npm run build`) if defined.
   - Dev server (e.g., `npm run dev`, `wrangler dev`) if it is the normal validation path.
   - Confirm no runtime/build errors in the console.
9. Perform a brief audit before committing:
   - **Security:** check for obvious vulnerabilities or unsafe handling introduced by your changes.
   - **Performance:** check for avoidable regressions (extra queries, heavy loops, unnecessary re-renders).
   - **Regression:** verify existing behavior that could be impacted still works.
10. If No-commit is false, commit changes using the `$commit` skill.
    - Stage everything: `git add -A`
    - Confirm a clean working tree after commit: `git status --porcelain` should be empty.
    - After committing, capture the commit hash and subject using:
      `git show -s --format="%h %s" HEAD`.
11. Append a progress entry to /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/progress.md with run/commit/test details (format below).
    If No-commit is true, skip committing and note it in the progress entry.

## Completion Signal
Only output the completion signal when the **selected story** is fully complete and verified.
When the selected story is complete, output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Otherwise, end normally without the signal.

## Additional Guardrails
- When authoring documentation, capture the why (tests + implementation intent).
- If you learn how to run/build/test the project, update /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/AGENTS.md briefly (operational only).
- Keep AGENTS operational only; progress notes belong in /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/progress.md.
- If you hit repeated errors, log them in /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/errors.log and add a Sign to /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/guardrails.md using /Users/andreasspannagel/Library/pnpm/global/5/.pnpm/@iannuttall+ralph@0.1.3/node_modules/@iannuttall/ralph/.agents/ralph/references/GUARDRAILS.md as the template.

## Activity Logging (Required)
Log major actions to /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/activity.log using the helper:
```
/Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/ralph log "message"
```
Log at least:
- Start of work on the story
- After major code changes
- After tests/verification
- After updating progress log

## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)
If the selected story changes UI, you MUST verify it in the browser:
1. Load the `dev-browser` skill.
2. Navigate to the relevant page.
3. Verify the UI changes work as expected.
4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log.

A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.
