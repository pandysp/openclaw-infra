### US-014: Fix MEMORY.md stale facts
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-013

Description:
As the AI assistant maintaining this project, I want MEMORY.md to contain accurate facts so that future sessions don't act on incorrect information.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] MEMORY.md qmd section: update tesseract timeout from '30s' to '60s' (matching extract.j2 line 43 SUBPROCESS_TIMEOUT = 60)
- [ ] MEMORY.md: verify tool count claims against current agent count and update or remove hardcoded totals
- [ ] Review other MEMORY.md facts that reference specific numbers or versions and verify they match current code
- [ ] Example: MEMORY.md says '30s subprocess timeout' -> updated to '60s subprocess timeout'
- [ ] Negative case: no facts in MEMORY.md contradict the current codebase after this story is complete
