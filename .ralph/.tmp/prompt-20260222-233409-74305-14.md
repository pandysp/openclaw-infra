## Selected Story (Do not change scope)
ID: US-015
Title: Investigate reusable Docker image build task

Story details:
### US-015: Investigate reusable Docker image build task
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-014

Description:
As a maintainer, I want to understand the feasibility and effort of extracting the 3 near-identical Docker image build blocks in plugins/tasks/main.yml into a single parameterized include so that future MCP server additions don't require copying 150 lines.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document the current duplication: list the 3 blocks (Codex, Claude Code, Pi) with their line ranges and identify which parts are identical vs. which differ
- [ ] Identify the parameters needed for a reusable build-mcp-image.yml: image name, build dir, Dockerfile template, container label, force rebuild var, smoke test commands
- [ ] Identify risks: are there any subtle differences between the 3 blocks that would make parameterization unsafe?
- [ ] Provide an effort estimate (small/medium/large) and a go/no-go recommendation
- [ ] Output is a brief document (can be inline in the story completion notes or a file in docs/)
- [ ] Negative case: if parameterization is not feasible (e.g., too many differences), explain why and close the story


If the story details are empty or missing, STOP and report that the PRD story format could not be parsed.

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Implement **only** the work required to complete the selected story.
- Complete all tasks associated with this story (and only this story).
- Do NOT ask the user questions.
- Do NOT change unrelated code.
- Do NOT assume something is unimplemented — confirm by reading code.
- Implement completely; no placeholders or stubs.
- If No-commit is true, do NOT commit or push changes.
- Do NOT edit the PRD JSON (status is handled by the loop).
- All changes made during the run must be committed (including updates to progress/logs).
 - Before committing, perform a final **security**, **performance**, and **regression** review of your changes.

## Your Task (Do this in order)
1. Read /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/guardrails.md before any code changes.
2. Read /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/errors.log for repeated failures to avoid.
3. Read /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.agents/tasks/prd-review-action-plan.json for global context (do not edit).
4. Fully audit and read all necessary files to understand the task end-to-end before implementing. Do not assume missing functionality.
5. If /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/AGENTS.md exists, follow its build/test instructions.
6. Implement only the tasks that belong to US-015.
7. Run verification commands listed in the story, the global quality gates, and in /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/AGENTS.md (if required).
8. If the project has a build or dev workflow, run what applies:
   - Build step (e.g., `npm run build`) if defined.
   - Dev server (e.g., `npm run dev`, `wrangler dev`) if it is the normal validation path.
   - Confirm no runtime/build errors in the console.
9. Perform a brief audit before committing:
   - **Security:** check for obvious vulnerabilities or unsafe handling introduced by your changes.
   - **Performance:** check for avoidable regressions (extra queries, heavy loops, unnecessary re-renders).
   - **Regression:** verify existing behavior that could be impacted still works.
10. If No-commit is false, commit changes using the `$commit` skill.
    - Stage everything: `git add -A`
    - Confirm a clean working tree after commit: `git status --porcelain` should be empty.
    - After committing, capture the commit hash and subject using:
      `git show -s --format="%h %s" HEAD`.
11. Append a progress entry to /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/progress.md with run/commit/test details (format below).
    If No-commit is true, skip committing and note it in the progress entry.

```

## Completion Signal
Only output the completion signal when the **selected story** is fully complete and verified.
When the selected story is complete, output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

Otherwise, end normally without the signal.

## Additional Guardrails
- When authoring documentation, capture the why (tests + implementation intent).
- If you learn how to run/build/test the project, update /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/AGENTS.md briefly (operational only).
- Keep AGENTS operational only; progress notes belong in /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/progress.md.
- If you hit repeated errors, log them in /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/errors.log and add a Sign to /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/guardrails.md using /Users/andreasspannagel/Library/pnpm/global/5/.pnpm/@iannuttall+ralph@0.1.3/node_modules/@iannuttall/ralph/.agents/ralph/references/GUARDRAILS.md as the template.

## Activity Logging (Required)
Log major actions to /Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/.ralph/activity.log using the helper:
```
/Users/andreasspannagel/projects/openclaw-infra/ralph log "message"
```
Log at least:
- Start of work on the story
- After major code changes
- After tests/verification
- After updating progress log

## Browser Testing (Required for Frontend Stories)
If the selected story changes UI, you MUST verify it in the browser:
1. Load the `dev-browser` skill.
2. Navigate to the relevant page.
3. Verify the UI changes work as expected.
4. Take a screenshot if helpful for the progress log.

A frontend story is NOT complete until browser verification passes.
