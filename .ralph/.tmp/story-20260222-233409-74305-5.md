### US-007: Fix Obsidian PAT exposure in git remote URLs
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-006

Description:
As a security-conscious deployer, I want GitHub PATs in Obsidian vault git remotes to not leak into Ansible logs so that credentials are not exposed in verbose provisioning output.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In ansible/roles/obsidian/tasks/vault.yml line ~95: add no_log: true to the 'Update remote URL' task (the clone task already has it)
- [ ] Verify all other tasks in vault.yml that handle the _obsidian_auth_url variable also have no_log: true
- [ ] Example: running ./scripts/provision.sh --tags obsidian -vvv does not show any GitHub PAT in the output
- [ ] Negative case: the clone and pull operations still work correctly with the PAT-embedded URL
- [ ] Add a comment noting that PATs persist in .git/config on disk and are accessible within the workspace directory
