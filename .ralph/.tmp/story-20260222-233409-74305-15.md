### US-016: Investigate data-driven agent variables
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-015

Description:
As a maintainer, I want to understand the feasibility of replacing the per-agent hardcoded variables in index.ts and provision.sh with data-driven loops so that adding a new agent doesn't require editing 10+ locations.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Document the current duplication: count the number of per-agent variable declarations, config reads, and exports in index.ts and provision.sh
- [ ] Propose a data structure (e.g., array of agent IDs) and show how the loops would work for deploy keys, secret reads, and Pulumi exports
- [ ] Identify risks: Pulumi resource naming changes could trigger resource replacement (destroy + recreate). Assess whether the refactor can preserve existing resource URNs
- [ ] Provide an effort estimate and go/no-go recommendation
- [ ] Output is a brief investigation document
- [ ] Negative case: if Pulumi resource URN changes would destroy existing deploy keys, recommend against or propose a migration path
