### US-001: Quote hostname interpolation in cloud-init
Status: in_progress
Depends on: None

Description:
As a deployer, I want the cloud-init hostname to be safely quoted so that a user-configured serverName with shell metacharacters cannot cause command injection running as root.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In pulumi/user-data.ts line 50, the --hostname argument is wrapped in double quotes: --hostname="${config.hostname}"
- [ ] Example: a hostname value of 'openclaw-vps' produces: tailscale up --authkey "file:/tmp/ts-authkey" --hostname="openclaw-vps" --ssh
- [ ] Negative case: a hostname value containing spaces or semicolons (e.g., 'test; rm -rf /') is safely quoted and does not execute as a separate command
- [ ] pulumi preview succeeds with the change
