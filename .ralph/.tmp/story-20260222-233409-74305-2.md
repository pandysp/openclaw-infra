### US-004: Fix dynamic inventory silent empty return on failure
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-003

Description:
As an operator, I want the Ansible dynamic inventory to fail loudly when Pulumi or Tailscale commands fail so that provisioning does not silently skip all tasks due to an empty inventory.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In ansible/inventory/pulumi_inventory.py: the run() function logs errors to stderr before returning None (include the command that failed and the error message)
- [ ] When the final inventory is empty (no hosts resolved), exit with a non-zero exit code and print a diagnostic message to stderr explaining why (Pulumi failed, Tailscale failed, no matching peers, etc.)
- [ ] The OPENCLAW_SSH_HOST override path still works: if the env var is set, Pulumi/Tailscale failures are acceptable (the override provides the host)
- [ ] Example: pulumi stack output fails due to missing passphrase -> inventory script exits non-zero with message 'Failed to resolve host: pulumi stack output failed: ...'
- [ ] Negative case: OPENCLAW_SSH_HOST=1.2.3.4 is set and Pulumi fails -> inventory returns the override host successfully (exit 0)
- [ ] Existing successful behavior is unchanged when Pulumi and Tailscale work correctly
