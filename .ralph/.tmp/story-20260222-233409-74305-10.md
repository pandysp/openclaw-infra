### US-011: Fix CLAUDE.md sandbox network documentation
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-010

Description:
As a developer reading CLAUDE.md, I want the sandbox configuration documentation to match the actual deployed state so that I don't debug connectivity issues based on wrong information.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] After US-006 changes sandbox back to bridge: CLAUDE.md Sandboxing section Config block shows agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.network: bridge
- [ ] The 'Why bridge networking' paragraph accurately explains that bridge provides outbound internet via Docker NAT
- [ ] Add a note that MCP containers (Codex, Claude Code, Pi) run on a separate codex-proxy-net network for proxy access
- [ ] The security model explanation mentions that sandbox containers are network-isolated from the credential proxy
- [ ] Example: a new contributor reads CLAUDE.md and correctly understands which containers are on which network
- [ ] Negative case: the documentation does not mention codex-proxy-net as the sandbox network (since US-006 changes it to bridge)
