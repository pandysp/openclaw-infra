### US-010: Add early SSH exit to verify.sh
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-009

Description:
As an operator, I want verify.sh to detect SSH failure early and skip subsequent SSH-dependent checks so that I see one clear 'SSH failed' error instead of 11 misleading service warnings.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In scripts/verify.sh: after the first SSH-dependent check (check 2), if SSH fails, print a clear error message and skip all remaining SSH checks
- [ ] The skip message explains the root cause: 'SSH connection failed — skipping remaining remote checks'
- [ ] Non-SSH checks (check 1: Tailscale ping) still run regardless
- [ ] Example: SSH is unreachable -> output shows check 1 (Tailscale ping) result, then 'SSH connection failed — skipping 11 remote checks'
- [ ] Negative case: SSH works -> all 13 checks run as before with no behavioral change
- [ ] The script exit code reflects the SSH failure (non-zero)
