### US-013: Fix server.ts misleading provisioning comment
Status: in_progress
Depends on: US-012

Description:
As a developer reading the Pulumi code, I want the server.ts comment to accurately describe the cloud-init/Ansible boundary so that I don't skip investigating Ansible after a failed deployment.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] In pulumi/server.ts lines 67-68: replace 'No need for additional provisioning' with a comment explaining that cloud-init bootstraps Tailscale only and Ansible handles all other configuration
- [ ] Example comment: 'Cloud-init bootstraps Tailscale only (~1 min). All other configuration is handled by Ansible (triggered by index.ts).'
- [ ] The replacement comment is concise (1-2 lines) and matches the style of existing comments in the file
- [ ] Negative case: the comment does not say 'no provisioning needed' or anything that implies cloud-init handles everything
