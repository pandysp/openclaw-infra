# Deployment-specific overrides (copy to openclaw.yml, which is gitignored).
# Values here take precedence over all.yml because the "openclaw" group
# is more specific than the "all" group in Ansible's variable precedence.
#
# Usage:
#   cp ansible/group_vars/openclaw.yml.example ansible/group_vars/openclaw.yml
#   # Edit openclaw.yml with your deployment-specific settings
#   ./scripts/provision.sh

# Enable remote Mac node exec (see docs/SECURITY.md §5 for risks)
# node_exec_enabled: true

# --- Multi-agent setup (uncomment and customize) ---
# By default, all.yml defines a single "main" agent. Adding agents here automatically
# generates per-agent MCP servers, workspaces, and token mappings (via playbook.yml
# pre_tasks). You only need to define agents — everything else derives from them.
#
# Prerequisites for each additional agent:
#   1. Add Pulumi secrets: telegramUserId, workspaceRepoUrl, githubToken (per-agent)
#   2. Wire them through scripts/provision.sh
#   3. Run: ./scripts/provision.sh
#
# openclaw_agents:
#   - id: "main"
#     is_default: true
#     deliver_to: "{{ telegram_user_id | default('') }}"
#     deliver_type: "dm"
#     heartbeat_every: "15m"
#   - id: "second-agent"
#     is_default: false
#     deliver_to: "{{ telegram_second_user_id | default('') }}"
#     deliver_type: "dm"
#     heartbeat_every: "1h"

# --- Cron jobs (override to customize schedules per agent) ---
# all.yml provides generic main-agent defaults (daily standup + night shift).
# Override here for custom prompts, additional agents, or personal schedules.
#
# openclaw_cron_jobs:
#   - name: "main: Daily Standup"
#     agent: "main"
#     schedule: "30 9 * * *"
#     message: "Good morning! Summarize what needs attention today."
#   - name: "main: Night Shift"
#     agent: "main"
#     schedule: "0 23 * * *"
#     message: "Night shift. Review notes, organize, triage tasks."
#   - name: "second-agent: Daily Standup"
#     agent: "second-agent"
#     schedule: "0 10 * * *"
#     message: "Good morning! Summarize what needs attention today."

# --- Obsidian vaults (default: none) ---
# Clone Obsidian vaults into agent workspaces. Requires GitHub PATs via provision.sh.
#
# openclaw_obsidian_vaults:
#   - name: "my-vault"
#     repo_url: "{{ obsidian_my_vault_repo_url | default('') }}"
#     agents: ["main"]

# --- Advanced: manual overrides for auto-generated config ---
# The following variables are normally auto-generated from openclaw_agents.
# Define them here ONLY if you need non-standard naming or custom server configurations.
#
# openclaw_mcp_servers:       # Override auto-generated MCP server list
# openclaw_workspaces:        # Override auto-generated workspace list
# openclaw_obsidian_github_tokens:  # Override auto-generated token mapping
