# Deployment-specific overrides (copy to local.yml, which is gitignored).
# Values here take precedence over all.yml.
#
# Usage:
#   cp ansible/group_vars/local.yml.example ansible/group_vars/local.yml
#   # Edit local.yml with your deployment-specific settings
#   ./scripts/provision.sh

# Enable remote Mac node exec (see docs/SECURITY.md §5 for risks)
# node_exec_enabled: true
